# Page Body
The user list cover's the whole body below the page header until a new user prompt is opened to add a new user. Then the body area divides in half, user list in the left half and new user prompt in the right half.
When the body divides in half to accommodate the user list and the new user prompt, there is slight whitespace between the two things.

## New User Prompt
- This opens on the right half of the body when the new user button in the header is pressed
- Has a heading of 'New User', aligned left, background strip of light gray-ish white color, running from start of New User text to almost the right margin of the body, background strip slightly wider then the New User text
- Under the heading, five input taking boxes with labels besides them to take user data, all appearing vertically one after another with equal whitespace in between

- Username, Display name, phone and email options have an empty white rectangular box, approximately with slightly more width then the label text, each box has a light gray-ish white border around it. When clicked on, a black cursor appears in each box where the user can then type the required information
- The user roles label also has a rectangular box in front of it with all the same specifications as above but has a gray colored text in it that is: 'Select user roles' (without the quotes), clicking the box takes this text away and shows a drop down menu box

- Clicking on any of the options in this drop down menu selects that as the role of this new user
- All these rectangular input taking boxes after the labels are equal in length and start at the same level
-  Any typed text in the box and the selected role appear as black, left aligned text in the respective rectangular boxes
- The last label (Enabled) has a small box in front of it, the box has black outline and white background. Clicking this box shows a white tick on a blue background in the box and sets the status of the user as enabled. If not checked, the user's enabled status remains false and is hidden if the hide disabled user checkbox in the header is checked
